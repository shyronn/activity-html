    <p style="font-family;color:#959595;font-size:16px">It has taken time for me to appreciate that architecture is not solely a building, a product is not simply an object, a photo is not merely an image, and certainly, a graphic is not just an illustration. If done successfully, each should awaken our senses; they should allow us to feel different, work well, revisit time, and ultimately communicate effectively.</p> 
    <p style="font-family;color:#959595;font-size:16px">At the core of these mediums exists a conversation between creativity, craft, and honesty; I carry this core to studioDre.com.</p>
